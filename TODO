TODO
P1
- Sort the pnr status by date of travel(ascending)
- Show the seat position(Mod 8.only for S1,B1)
- Show full detail instead of abbrevated form (i.e. Instead CNF S3,51,GN showing as Confirmed, S3,54,General & Seat position(like Upper))
- Rework on the UI for better usability and show the information mentioned above in best way.

P2
- Print ticket directly from the extension . Save HTML leaving last 2 tables which contain adbanner & 
instructions which s not needed . By this we can print 2 tickets in a page . Green initiative :)
- Add option to post for prediction analysis in indiarailinfo.com (not sure if the site owner would like it)
- Use trainenquiry.com to predict arrival time if journey is currently on. (via @logic)

DONE
- Change UI (current UI sucks) - 21 June
- Add help page after install
- Tighter integration with IRCTC - added to post-ticket-book page.
- Show starting and end destination

SKIPPED
- Add hooks in cleartrip as well - I guess few people use cleartrip for trains, will do it if someone needs it.
