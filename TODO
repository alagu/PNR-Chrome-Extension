TODO
- Print ticket directly from the extension
- Add option to post for prediction analysis in indiarailinfo.com (not sure if the site owner would like it)
- Use trainenquiry.com to predict arrival time if journey is currently on. (via @logic)

Usability improvements

- Sort the pnr status by date of travel(ascending)
- Show the seat position(Mod 8.except for F1,C1,D1,A1)
- Show full detail instead of abbrevated form


DONE
- Change UI (current UI sucks) - 21 June
- Add help page after install
- Tighter integration with IRCTC - added to post-ticket-book page.

SKIPPED
- Add hooks in cleartrip as well - I guess few people use cleartrip for trains, will do it if someone needs it.
