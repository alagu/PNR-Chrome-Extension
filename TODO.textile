h1 TODO
h2 P1
 *  Add option to post for prediction analysis in indiarailinfo.com (not sure if the site owner would like it)
 *  Put the departure time of the train

h2 P2
 * Show the seat position(Mod 8.only for S1,B1)
 * Show full detail instead of abbrevated form (i.e. Instead CNF S3,51,GN showing as Confirmed, S3,54,General & Seat position(like Upper))
 * Print ticket directly from the extension
 * Use trainenquiry.com to predict arrival time if journey is currently on. (via @logic)



h1 DONE

 * Sort the pnr status by date of travel(ascending) - 6 Aug
 * Show starting and end destination - 6 Aug
 * Rework on the UI for better usability and show the information mentioned above in best way. Thanks to Anu and Briji! - 5 Aug
 * Change UI (current UI sucks) - 21 June
 * Add help page after install
 * Tighter integration with IRCTC - added to post-ticket-book page.

h1 SKIPPED
- Add hooks in cleartrip as well - I guess few people use cleartrip for trains, will do it if someone needs it.
